## 🔥 About  
**Cyber Security Multi-Tool Launcher** is a unified GUI-based platform that integrates powerful **network scanning, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and forensic tools** into a single tool.  
Instead of manually running multiple tools, users can launch and manage them through **one centralized interface** with just a click.  

This project is designed for **cybersecurity students, penetration testers, and researchers** to save time and enhance workflow efficiency.  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  
Cybersecurity professionals and students often face difficulty switching between different tools such as **Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus, Metasploit, and Burp Suite**.  
Each tool requires separate installation, command usage, and reporting, which makes workflow slow and inefficient.  

This project solves that by providing a **single GUI launcher** to run multiple tools and view outputs in one place.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To integrate multiple cybersecurity tools in a **single GUI launcher**.  
- To simplify **network scanning, vulnerability analysis, and penetration testing**.  
- To provide a centralized **reporting mechanism**.  
- To improve productivity for **cybersecurity students, analysts, and professionals**.

## ⚙️ Functional Requirements  
1. The system should provide a **GUI interface** for selecting tools.  
2. The system should allow **network scanning** using Nmap, Angry IP Scanner, Advanced IP Scanner, etc.  
3. The system should allow **vulnerability assessment** using Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, etc.  
4. The system should support **penetration testing** using Metasploit, Burp Suite, Acunetix, etc.  
5. The system should allow **monitoring & forensics** using Wireshark, Maltego, NetworkMiner, etc.  
6. The system should support **launching tools with a single command**.  
7. The system should support **report generation** (CSV, PDF, JSON).
